How can I prepare myself aiming 8 in the IELTS within 10-15 days?

If your level of English is proficient, then Band 8 (very nearly fluent) is certainly possible. You just need to practice and have someone check your writing and speaking.




However, if your level is not Band 8.0, then there is nothing you can do. IELTS just reads your level of English across the 4 skills. There are no tips, tricks, shortcuts to higher marks. It doesnâ€™t work like that.
